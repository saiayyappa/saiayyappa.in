TLDR! In short, don't read further

## My playful childhood and schooling

When I say playful I literally mean playing mario games with my pc all day.
It wasn't even a console. I used a optical CD which is trend those days and
emulatore called zsnes which is popular nintendo emulation software at that time. Schooling was kind of enjoying for me.

## College Phase

Being suffereing from introvertedness, I don't have much friends from school. Though in college many respected my geekiness. I loved breaking and fixing stuffs at that time especially assembling my own PC and rooting my mobile. On weekends I setup LAN multiplayer gaming network with my friends.

I hated programming at that time, to the point of me being not actively using it for anything other than my field. ðŸ‘€ Actually being an electrical engineering student had its own perks. So I was always given priority when delving in hardwares and stuffs. I was lucky in that sense.

After completing my degree, I did a short stint as physics school teacher, since I always was fascinated with teaching and my love for **physics**. I was in denial about my career path and continued with my masters in electrical engineering.

## Le project

As it was nearing completion of my masters, my project mentor asked whether I want to join as research scholar. To my surprise, I myself denied my passion for research because of circumstance and situation. Though it was clear as day, being in research is superior but being a software developer has its own perk as well. The project I did in my finals pushed me towards finding my passion in coding again. ðŸ˜† Name of my project is complicated, you can refer [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8719311).

This new found love pushed me entering the world of programming. `Le Hello World!!!`

## Web Development

My journey towards it started with the help of my good friend who guided me with some basic get started courses as well as my up kill tree. I first joined a tier 2 IT company, which helped me enable me in full stack engineering.

That's all! I became a web developer. Funny thing was I sometimes speculate, why I even code? But it's out of joy. Hope reading this when I am old, will give me same invigoration/enthusiam.

The point of scribbling this is purely to pass time. No useful thing has been achieved but still writing is a good hobby.

> Okay, Ciao! my future self!
